Certainly! Here are the steps to run a CodeIgniter 3 project on another local computer in simpler terms:

1)Copy Your Project: Copy all the files of your CodeIgniter project to the new computer. Use a USB drive or some other method to transfer them.

2)Web Server: Make sure your new computer has a web server installed. It's like the software that allows your website to work. Common choices are Apache or Nginx.

3)Set Up Your Project: Configure the web server to show your website. This means telling the server where your project is located.

4)Database: If your project uses a database, copy it from your old computer to the new one. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin or the command line for this.

5)PHP: Ensure that your new computer has PHP installed. It's the programming language your CodeIgniter project uses. Check if it's the right version and has the necessary features.

6)Display Errors: Tell your new computer to show any errors in your code. This helps with debugging. You can do this in the project's code.

7)URLs: Adjust the project's settings to match the new computer's address. You can do this in the project's configuration.

8)Test: Open a web browser and see if your project works on the new computer. If it does, great!

9)Fix Problems: If there are any issues, check the error logs to figure out what's wrong and try to fix them.

10)Backup: Always keep backups of your project files and database, just in case something goes wrong during the transfer.

That's it! These steps should help you get your CodeIgniter project running on another computer.
